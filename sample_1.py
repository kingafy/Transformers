GPT-2 as well as some other models (GPT, XLNet, Transfo-XL, CTRL) make use of a past or mems attribute which can be used to prevent re-computing the key/value pairs when using sequential decoding. It is useful when generating sequences as a big part of the attention mechanism benefits from previous computations.

Here is a fully-working example using the past with GPT2LMHeadModel and argmax decoding (which should only be used as an example, as argmax decoding introduces a lot of repetition):
'''

import torch

tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('gpt2')

generated = tokenizer.encode("The Manhattan bridge")
context = torch.tensor([generated])
past = None

for i in range(100):
    print(i)
