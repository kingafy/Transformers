Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar (/Àås åt É…™n t…õnÀàduÀêlk…ôr/ (About this soundlisten); born 24 April 1973) is an Indian former international cricketer and a former captain of the Indian national team. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket.[4] He is the highest run scorer of all time in International cricket.
Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at the age of sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India internationally for close to twenty-four years. He is the only player to have scored one hundred international centuries, the first batsman to score a double century in a One Day International (ODI), the holder of the record for the most runs in both Test and ODI, and the only player to complete more than 30,000 runs in international cricket..
